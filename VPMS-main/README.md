# 🏥 Velasco Patient Management System

### Final Project Proposal for LBYCPA2

**Team:** Matt Sebastian Aquino, John Carlo Cheng Roa, Kurt Gabrielle Lim, Wayne Ian Tolentino

## 📝 Background

The **Velasco Patient Management System** is a fast, low-cost, and resource-efficient Patient Management System specifically designed for facilities with limited IT infrastructure.

## ✨ Key Functionalities

The system provides the following core features:

* **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Ensures proper allocation of staff to rooms and equipment that is effective for both the staff and the patient.
* **User Action Tracking and Undo:** Improves convenience by allowing users (staff and patient) to revert the most recent changes committed into the system.
* **Staff Directory:** Includes an organized digital directory of hospital staff, sorted mainly by hierarchy, specialization, and availability.
* **Record Retrieval:** Allows staff to instantly access patient records, such as medical histories and treatment updates, with a low search time.
* **Patient Priority Queue:** Ensures critical patients are attended first via a priority queue system.
